Here is the list of features I am planning to add/need help with

-   Client: the `up.sh` file attached in the repo is a simple curl wrapper, it doesn't work. if you are a bash expert, show off your skills :D
-   Planning to add a systemd service file soon
-   Maybe somewhere in distant future, I might RiiR

-   check if header as "Accept" json, then send json else send text :D (text/plain and application/json)

-   let users control which ui to show
-   let users control which features (url and files) to enable ( user might want to have only URLs)
-   integrate with Solid DB
